# Hi! I'm Joon. I study coding by myself.
This is my first mini project that tried to connect React-app with Server/Database.

I made a very simple todolist website and all the joblists you make are will be saved in the database.

I learned basic mechanism between frontend and backend which is connection of user and server while making this project.

    * What technologies(language, module..etc) i used.
    Html / CSS / React / node.js / nodemon / body-parser / axios / express / cors / dotenv / mongoDB / mongoose

    * what did i use for learning about this project
    - all the offical website for language and modules.
      (MDN, React, Mongoose, Axios, Express, Node)
    - Leraned basic coding in react from "freecodecamp" basic react course in youtube.

# How to start.

    npm start
    Runs the app in the development mode.
    Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

    The page will reload when you make changes.
    You may also see any lint errors in the console.
